## Project Introduction

WutheringWavesPic is a gallery of character panels prepared for the [WutheringWavesUID](#external-links) plugin. Initially intended as an archive for my bot, I decided to make it public since there doesn't seem to be a similar repository on GitHub. This project is now available for newcomers to use.

## Usage

Download this project and place it in the `gsuid_core/data/WutheringWavesUID/custom_role_pile/` directory.

## Welcome PRs

We welcome everyone to contribute image PRs to this project! Please follow these guidelines when submitting images:

- Images should have appropriate dimensions for character panel display.
- As a general-purpose gallery, please avoid R18 content and strictly prohibit R18G images.
- Prioritize images that showcase the character's unique features.
- Avoid images with obvious AI artifacts.

## Image Sources

All images in this project are sourced from the internet, with some cropped for better presentation. If any image infringes copyright, please contact me, and I will remove it immediately.

## Feedback Channels

If you have bot-related needs or prefer not to upload images via GitHub, feel free to join my QQ group [Solaris Research Institute (Group ID: 966605967)](https://qm.qq.com/q/A4vpkqQH9C). The group allows image uploads, and I will periodically sync the images to this project.

## Future Plans

Considering repository capacity, future updates may involve splitting the repository. Feel free to provide feedback in my QQ group or submit an issue.
